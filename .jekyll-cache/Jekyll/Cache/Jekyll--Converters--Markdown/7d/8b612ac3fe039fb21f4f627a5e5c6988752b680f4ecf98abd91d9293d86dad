<h1 id="google-earth-engine-sign-up">Google Earth Engine Sign Up</h1>

<p>We are going to use Google Earth Engine (GEE) to download some satelite data.  This will require a Google account so that you can access GEE and Google Drive.</p>

<p><strong class="label label-red">1</strong> Go to <a href="https://www.google.com/">google.com</a> and create an account following the Sign In button if you donâ€™t already have one.</p>

<ul>
  <li>A google account will give you access to google drive with 15 GB free storage space!  This could be a useful resource when working on your final projects!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong class="label label-red">2</strong> Then got to <a href="https://earthengine.google.com/">earthengine</a> and sign up</p>

<ul>
  <li>Choose sign up in the top right.</li>
  <li>Follow the instructions to sign up using your Google account.</li>
  <li>Once you have gone through the sign up process, you can close GEE.  Weâ€™ll go back to it later.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note</strong> If you are unable to create an account, contact your TA for a link to the data set.</p>

<h1 id="create-a-project">Create a Project</h1>

<p><strong class="label label-blue">1</strong> Create a new project in ArcPro called Van_NDVI.  You can reference the <a href="https://june-skeeter.github.io/Module1_GEOS270/docs/Application_Part3.html#setting-up-a-project">Module 1</a> for a refresher on setting up a project.</p>

<p><strong class="label label-blue">2</strong> Weâ€™re going to work with some Canadian Census Data.  It has already been downloaded for you, weâ€™ll learn how to download census data in Module 3.  For now, use the button below to download the data.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Extract the Van_Census.zip file to your newly created project Van_NDVI folder.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://github.com/June-Skeeter/Module2_GEOS270/raw/main/data/Van_Census.zip" class="btn btn-blue">Download</a></p>

<h2 id="set-up-your-geodatabase">Set Up Your GeoDatabase</h2>

<p>By default, ArcPro creates a geodatabase with every new project.  You will see one called <strong>Van_NDVI.gdb</strong> in your project folder.</p>

<p><strong>Geodatabase</strong>: A file management structure that is unique to ESRI products. You donâ€™t have to store your data in a geodatabase (.gdb), but they have some enhanced functionality that makes them better than regular folders in some circumstances.  One helpful thing we can do in a .gdb, is create a feature dataset to store our census data.</p>

<p><strong>Feature Dataset</strong>: A collections of feature classes that are all in the same coordinate system.  When you add a data to a feature dataset, it will <em>automatically</em> be projected into the coordinate system we specify.  This can help us avoid making mistakes like working with data that is in the wrong coordinate system!  We are going to use a Universal Transverse Mercator projection  (UTM Zone 10N) since we are working with a small area (Vancouver).</p>

<p><strong>Feature Class</strong>: A vector data layer stored in a geodatabase.  Its a special file type created by ESRI to store data effectively within ArcGIS Pro.  When vector data layers are not stored in a geodatabase, they are stored in other formats, such as shapefiles or geojsons.  Weâ€™ll cover the distinctions more in lecture.</p>

<p>Follow the steps below to setup your geodatabase.  You can reference the video to see how to create one.</p>

<p><strong class="label label-red">1</strong> Create a new Feature Dataset named <strong>CensusData</strong> feature dataset.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Right click Van_NDVI.gdbÂ Â» New Feature Dataset</li>
</ul>

<p><strong class="label label-red">2</strong> Set the Coordinate System to NAD 1983 UTM Zone 10N</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>NAD 1983</strong> is the name of the datum (North American Datum 1983), <strong>UTM Zone 10N</strong> is the name of the projection (Universal Transverse Mercator, Zone 10 N)</li>
  <li>You can set this coordinate system to your favorites by right clicking and selecting add to favorites.  This will make it easier to find in the future!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong class="label label-red">3</strong> After you click Run, it will appear in your Van_NDVI.gdb.  Now weâ€™re going to add some census data.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Right click on your newly created <strong>CensusData</strong> feature datasetÂ Â» Import Feature Class(es)</li>
  <li>Add the two census data layers you downloaded: <strong>Van_DA_2016.shp</strong> and <strong>VanCMS_CT_2016.shp</strong></li>
</ul>

<h1 id="create-the-project-boundary-file">Create the Project Boundary File</h1>

<p>We need to create a simple boundary file to upload to Google Earth Engine so we can download satellite for our study area.  We can do this quickly using the dissolve tool.</p>

<p><strong class="label label-red">1</strong> In the Geoprocessing pane, find the Dissolve tool.</p>

<p><strong class="label label-red">2</strong> Set VanCMA_CT_2016 as the input</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Note</strong>: The output will be saved to your Van_NDVI.gdb as a feature class by default, but feature classes can not be read by Google Earth Engine.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Instead</em>: save the output as a <strong>Shapefile</strong> (.shp) one level up in your Van_NDVI project folder and name it <strong>Boundary</strong>.  Shapefiles are just a different way of storing vector data.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong class="label label-red">3</strong> Remove this layer from your table of contents.  We donâ€™t need it in this map project.</p>
