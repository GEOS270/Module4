What is NDVI and what is it used for and how is it calculated? What do high and low NDVI values represent respectively? What patterns do you see in the NDVI data for the metro Vancouver area?</p>

<p><a href="Application_Part3.md#a-note-on-linear-regression"><strong>2</strong></a>
Looking at the <strong>VanDA_2016</strong> layer, for every $100 increase in income at the DA level, how much does rental price increase?</p>

<p><a href="Application_Part3.md#a-note-on-linear-regression"><strong>3</strong></a>
Looking at the <strong>VanDA_2016</strong> layer, what is the R2 score for this model?</p>

<p><a href="Application_Part3.md#comparing-cts-to-das"><strong>4</strong></a>

<p><a href="Application_Part3.md#use-the-natural-breaks-classification"><strong>6</strong></a>
What value does the Natural Breaks method determine should denotes the lower bound of the ‚ÄúGreen Vegetation‚Äù class? <strong>Hint</strong>:  Look at the Start/End values when applying the natural breaks classification.</p>

<p><a href="Application_Part4.md#data-normalization"><strong>20</strong></a>

<p><a href="Application_Part4.md#inspect-and-compare-the-outputs"><strong>21</strong></a>
Describe the relationship between the <strong>Mean</strong> NDVI value per DA and and the <strong>Green Veg Fraction</strong> per DA.  Are they telling us the same thing?  How Strongly are they related?</p>

<p><a href="Application_Part4.md#inspect-and-compare-the-outputs"><strong>22</strong></a>
What is the R2 score for <strong>Green Veg Fraction</strong> vs. <strong>Income</strong>?</p>

<p><a href="Application_Part4.md#inspect-and-compare-the-outputs"><strong>23</strong></a>
What is the R2 score for <strong>Mean</strong> vs. <strong>Income</strong>?</p>

<p><a href="Application_Part4.md#inspect-and-compare-the-outputs"><strong>24</strong></a>
Are either of these variables strongly linked to income? Explain why or why not?  Are there any improvement you think we could make to this analysis?</p>

______ have well defined boundaries.  They are countable, meaning there is only a finite number of them.

[**2**](Content_Part1_1.md)
______ lack well defined boundaries.  Because of this, they can be measured at an infinite number of locations.

[**3**](Content_Part1_1.md)
We rarely work with multiple types of phenomena at once in GIS because it is too complicated. [T/F]

[**4**](Content_Part1_2.md)
For these data types, we cannot calculate meaningful numerical statistics.  (Select all that apply).

- Nominal
- Ordinal
- Interval
- Ratio

[**5**](Content_Part1_2.md)
Briefly discuss the difference between qualitative and quantitative data and their respective sub-types.

[**6**](Content_Part2_0.md)
Negative spatial autocorrelation indicates clustering. [T/F]

[**7**](Content_Part2_1.md)
The ______ data model represents space as a continuous grid of cells and each cell can contain only one attribute.

[**8**](Content_Part2_2.md)
The ______ data model represents features in space as discrete two-dimensional polygons, one-dimensional lines , and/or "zero-dimensional" points.  Attribute(s) are stored separately in a table, and each row can have numerous attributes.

[**9**](Content_Part2_2.md)
Polygons can be single part or multipart [T/F].

[**10**](Content_Part2_3.md)
Both types of phenomena can be represented using either the data model.  But generally speaking, continuous fields phenomena are better represented by the ______ model and discrete objects are better represented by the ______ data model.

[**11**](Content_Part2_3.md)
Higher resolution rasters have smaller cells which means they take less memory to store. [T/F]

[**12**](Content_Part2_3.md)
The ______ pertains to how we assign data values to grid cells that cover more than one value.

[**13**](Content_Part2_3.md)
Resolution is a property of the [data/map/both], scale is a property of the [data/map/both].
