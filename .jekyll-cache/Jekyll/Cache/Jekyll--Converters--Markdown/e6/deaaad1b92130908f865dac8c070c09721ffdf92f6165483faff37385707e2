<p>All written answers should be numbered and record in one document, saved as a .pdf, and uploaded to canvas.  The file submissions should also be saved as .pdf and uploaded as a separate document.  <strong>Written answers can be as brief as you want as long as they answer the question.</strong></p>

<p><a href="Application_Part2.md#wa1"><strong>WA1</strong></a> 8 pts
What is NDVI and what is it used for?  Describe the patterns you see in NDVI across the metro Vancouver area.</p>

<p>NDVI is a metric for gauging vegetation health/density/”greenness”.  It is based off the differential reflectivity between red (low for plants) and near infrared (high for plants).  Across metro van - water/concrete low, residential w/ tree cover medium, forests/agriculture high</p>

<p><a href="Application_Part3.md#wa3"><strong>WA2</strong></a> 2 pts
What are the differences you notice between the CTs and DAs in terms of size and population?</p>

<p>CDAs are smaller population/size wise, DAs give full coverage CTs only in CMA (metro areas)</p>

<p><a href="Application_Part5.md#wa3"><strong>WA3</strong></a> 8 pts
What does data normalization do? How does normalizing effect the relationship with income? Create a new chart with Green Vegetation Fraction on the X-axis and Income on the Y-axis to find out.  How does this compare to when we were looking at the relationship between Total Green Vegetation Area and income?</p>

<p>Normalizing accounts for a confounding/secondary/other variable by dividing the variable of interest by the confounder.  This helps control for correlation between the two variables. The R2 score goes up to 0.083, Accounting for the different sizes of the DA “improves” the relationship. But not by much</p>

<p><a href="Application_Part6.md#wa4"><strong>WA4</strong></a> 12 pts
What do the results of this analysis show?  Are there any improvement you think we could make to this analysis?</p>

<p>The relationship isn’t strong, probably because there are other factors that are determine where people with limited resources can afford to live and where those with money choose to live. (7.5 pts)</p>

<p>Things to look at might include: housing cost (rent or land value) instead of income.  Both NDVI &amp; green area combined (eg. multivariate linear regression). Excluding downtown core and focus on just medium density residential areas.  Account for water/beaches (also attracts high income but low NDIV)  .  These are just possible suggestions, they don’t have to list these anything that makes sense counts (7.5 pts for listing two or more suggestions, 3.25 pts if just one).</p>

<p><a href="Content_Part2.md#wc1"><strong>WC1</strong></a> - 5pts
Briefly discuss what resolution means with regards to raster and vector data.</p>

<p>Raster resolution is defined by the cell size - smaller cells = higher resolution
Vector resolution is less straightforward.  Determined by density of points representing polygons/lines.</p>
