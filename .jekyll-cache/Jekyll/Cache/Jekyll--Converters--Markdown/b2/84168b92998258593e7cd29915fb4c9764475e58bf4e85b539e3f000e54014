<strong>__</strong> have well defined boundaries.  They are countable, meaning there is only a finite number of them.</p>

<p><a href="Content_Part1_1.md"><strong>2</strong></a>
<strong>__</strong> lack well defined boundaries.  Because of this, they can be measured at an infinite number of locations.</p>

<p><a href="Content_Part1_1.md"><strong>3</strong></a>
We rarely work with multiple types of phenomena at once in GIS because it is too complicated. [T/F]</p>

<p><a href="Content_Part1_2.md"><strong>4</strong></a>
For these data types, we cannot calculate meaningful numerical statistics.  (Select all that apply).</p>

<ul>
  <li>Nominal</li>
  <li>Ordinal</li>
  <li>Interval</li>
  <li>Ratio</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="Content_Part1_2.md"><strong>5</strong></a>
Briefly discuss the difference between qualitative and quantitative data and their respective sub-types.</p>

<p><a href="Content_Part2_0.md"><strong>6</strong></a>
Negative spatial autocorrelation indicates clustering. [T/F]</p>

<p><a href="Content_Part2_1.md"><strong>7</strong></a>
The <strong>__</strong> data model represents space as a continuous grid of cells and each cell can contain only one attribute.</p>

<p><a href="Content_Part2_2.md"><strong>8</strong></a>
The <strong>__</strong> data model represents features in space as discrete two-dimensional polygons, one-dimensional lines , and/or ‚Äúzero-dimensional‚Äù points.  Attribute(s) are stored separately in a table, and each row can have numerous attributes.</p>

<p><a href="Content_Part2_2.md"><strong>9</strong></a>
Polygons can be single part or multipart [T/F].</p>

<p><a href="Content_Part2_3.md"><strong>10</strong></a>
Both types of phenomena can be represented using either the data model.  But generally speaking, continuous fields phenomena are better represented by the <strong>__</strong> model and discrete objects are better represented by the <strong>__</strong> data model.</p>

<p><a href="Content_Part2_3.md"><strong>11</strong></a>
Higher resolution rasters have smaller cells which means they take less memory to store. [T/F]</p>

<p><a href="Content_Part2_3.md"><strong>12</strong></a>
The <strong>__</strong> pertains to how we assign data values to grid cells that cover more than one value.</p>

<p><a href="Content_Part2_3.md"><strong>13</strong></a>
Resolution is a property of the [data/map/both], scale is a property of the [data/map/both].</p>
