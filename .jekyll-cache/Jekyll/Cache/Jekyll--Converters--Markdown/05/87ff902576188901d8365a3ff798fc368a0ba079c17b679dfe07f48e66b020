<p>Now that weâ€™ve covered how we project spatial data, we can learn how we actually represent that spatial data in a computer.  But first, lets take a step back and talk more broadly about data.</p>

<details>
<summary>What are data?</summary>

<i>A collection of information (qualitative or quantiative) that describe a phenomena.</i>

</details>
<p><br /></p>

<details>
<summary>What makes spatial data different from other types of data?</summary>

<i>The spatial coordinates must be treated differently (projected).  Further, spatial relationshps like proximity must be accounted for.</i>

</details>
<p><br /></p>

<details>
<summary>Do similar issues arise with temporal data?</summary>

<i>Yes!  Time units must be treated differently and temporal relationshps like proximity are generally important.</i>
