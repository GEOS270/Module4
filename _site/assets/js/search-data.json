    "content": "# Overview This lab gives you an introduction into how to conduct a \"full\" GIS workflow. ## Research Question What is the relationship between neighborhood green vegetation coverage and housing cost in Vancouver? # Workflow How we will answer the research question: 1) Estimate vegetation coverage with satellite data and overlay census data. 2) Plot the relationship between vegetation coverage and income and run linear regression analysis. 3) Visualize the results. ## Spatial Data Models In this lab, we are going to explore ways to work with both Vector Data and Raster Data. We'll cover some specifics of these spatial data models in lecture. For now, just remember this. We use the **Raster Data Model** for *satellite data* and the **Vector Data Model** for *census data*. ### Acknowledgments - This lab was written by June Skeeter using content adapted from lab assignments created by Naomi Schwartz and Sally Hermansen.

This will require a Google account so that you can access GEE and Google Drive. **1**{: .label .label-red } Go to [google.com](https://www.google.com/) and create an account following the Sign In button if you don't already have one. * A google account will give you access to google drive with 15 GB free storage space! This could be a useful resource when working on your final projects! **2**{: .label .label-red } Then got to [earthengine](https://earthengine.google.com/) and sign up * Choose sign up in the top right. * Follow the instructions to sign up using your Google account. * Once you have gone through the sign up process, you can close GEE. We'll go back to it later. **Note** If you are unable to create an account, contact your TA for a link to the data set. # Create a Project **1**{: .label .label-blue } Create a new project in ArcPro called **Van_NDVI**. * You can reference the [Module 1](https://geos270.github.io/Module1/docs/Application_Part3.html) for a refresher on setting up a project. **2**{: .label .label-blue } We're going to work with some Canadian Census Data. You learned how to download census data in Module 3. I've gone ahead and downloaded the relevant data for you already to save a bit of time. You can use the button below to download the data. * Extract the Van_Census.zip file to your newly created project Van_NDVI folder. [Download](https://github.com/GEOS270/Module4//raw/main/data/Van_Census.zip){: .btn .btn-blue } ## Set Up Your GeoDatabase By default, ArcPro creates a geodatabase with every new project. You will see one called **Van_NDVI.gdb** in your project folder. **Geodatabase**: A file management structure that is unique to ESRI products. You don't have to store your data in a geodatabase (.gdb), but they have some enhanced functionality that makes them better than regular folders in some circumstances. One helpful thing we can do in a .gdb, is create a feature dataset to store our census data. **Feature Dataset**: A collections of feature classes that are all in the same coordinate system. When you add a data to a feature dataset, it will *automatically* be projected into the coordinate system we specify. This can help us avoid making mistakes like working with data that is in the wrong coordinate system! We are going to use a Universal Transverse Mercator projection (UTM Zone 10N) since we are working with a small area (Vancouver). * Feature Datasets are only used for **Vector** Data **Feature Class**: A vector data layer stored in a geodatabase. Its a special file type created by ESRI to store data effectively within ArcGIS Pro. When vector data layers are not stored in a geodatabase, they are stored in other formats, such as shapefiles or geojsons. We'll cover the distinctions more in lecture. * Feature Class is a type of **Vector** data unique to ESRI programs Follow the steps below to setup your geodatabase. You can reference the video to see how to create one. **1**{: .label .label-red } Create a new Feature Dataset named **CensusData** feature dataset. * Right click Van_NDVI.gdb >> New Feature Dataset **2**{: .label .label-red } Set the Coordinate System to NAD 1983 UTM Zone 10N * **NAD 1983** is the name of the datum (North American Datum 1983), **UTM Zone 10N** is the name of the projection (Universal Transverse Mercator, Zone 10 N) * You can set this coordinate system to your favorites by right clicking and selecting add to favorites. This will make it easier to find in the future! **3**{: .label .label-red } After you click Run, it will appear in your Van_NDVI.gdb. Now we're going to add some census data. * Right click on your newly created **CensusData** feature dataset >> Import Feature Class(es) * Add the two census data layers you downloaded: **Van_DA_2016.shp** and **VanCMS_CT_2016.shp** Your browser does not support iframes.

TOC {:toc} --- # Monitoring Vegetation with Satelites We're going to work with [LANDSAT8](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/landsat-8) data in this lab. LANDSAT8 is one of a large number of satellites that orbit the earth continuously collecting multi-spectral (visible light & other wavelengths) imagery. We can use multi-spectral imagery for a number of different applications like estimating vegetation health. The lines on the chart below are referred to as a spectral reflectance curves. They show reflectance (amount of light) on the y-axis, defined as the percent of radiation reflected by different earth features, and wavelength on the x-axis. As you can see, the spectral reflectance curves for different features look very different. Specifically, you can see that healthy green vegetation has very high reflectance in the near-infrared wavelengths (0.7-1.4 µm) and lower reflectance in the visible part of the spectrum (0-0.7 µm), while water absorbs almost all incoming infrared radiation and thus has very low infrared reflectance. Soil has relatively higher reflectance in the visible wavelengths, and intermediate reflectance in the near infrared. Your browser does not support iframes. View Image in New Tab ## Calculating NDVI These differences are the basis for the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), one of the most commonly used spectral indices for vegetation monitoring. NDVI is calculated as: $$ NDVI = \\frac{(NIR-Red)}{(NIR+Red)} $$ where NIR is reflectance in the near-infrared wavelengths, and RED is reflectance in the red wavelengths. This index can range from -1 to 1, with higher values indicating more/greener/healthier vegetation. Look at the graph above and make sure you understand why green vegetation would have a high value of NDVI. The gray shaded areas indicate regions of the electromagnetic spectrum that are measured by a satellite. These regions are referred to as “spectral bands.” When you work with satellite imagery, you will have one raster for each band. The values for each raster contain the reflectance measured by the satellite in that band. (This will make more sense in a minute, when you start working with the satellite data). # Using Google Earth Engine **1**{: .label .label-red } Go to the [GEE code Explorer](https://code.earthengine.google.com/), log in if you need to, and create a new Repository called **Van_NDVI_Download**. **2**{: .label .label-red } Now create an New File, make sure its located within the Van_NDVI_Download repository you just created, and name it **Landsat8_NDIV_Download**. **3**{: .label .label-red } Copy the following Javascript code from in the grey box below and paste it into the code pane (top middle). ```javascript // Coordinates for Vancouver var Cent = ee.Geometry.Point([-123,49.25]); // Center Map on Vancouver Map.centerObject(Cent, 10); // Import the Landsat 8 TOA image collection. // Filter out images with cloud covdf > 10% var Collection = ee.ImageCollection('LANDSAT/LC08/C01/T1_TOA').filter(ee.Filter.lt('CLOUD_COVER_LAND', 10)); // Get the number of images. var count = Collection.size(); print('Count: ', count); // Define NDVI Function var addNDVI_Landsat = function(image) { var ndvi = image.normalizedDifference(['B5', 'B4']).rename('NDVI'); return image.addBands(ndvi); }; // Apply Function to all Images var withNDVI_Landsat = Collection.map(addNDVI_Landsat); // Make a \"greenest\" pixel composite. var greenest = withNDVI_Landsat.qualityMosaic('NDVI'); var ndvi = greenest.select('NDVI') // Define Color Scheme for Visualization var ndviParams = {min: -.5, max: 1, palette: ['blue', 'white', 'green']}; // Display the result.

View Image in New Tab ## Retrieve the Download Go to your [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/my-drive) and find the Van_Greenest.tif, it should be located in the root folder. It could take 5/10 minutes for GEE to process your request. Right click on it to download it an put it in your Van_NDVI folder. # Project the Raster Layer By default, data from GEE is not projected! It comes in the WGS 1984 Geographic Coordinate System (Lat/Lon referencing the WGS 1984 Datum). We need to get it into NAD 1983 UTM Zone 10N so it matches the rest of our data! Feature Datasets only work for **Vector** data. The NDVI data is in the **Raster** data format. So we have to reproject it manually. Raster data requires a slightly different tool to do the re-projection than the vector data we worked with in Modules 1-3. The steps and video below goes shows you how to do that. **1**{: .label .label-blue } In the Geoprocessing pane, search for the Project Raster tool. **2**{: .label .label-blue } Set the projection to UTM Zone 10N (find in your favorites for quick access). **3**{: .label .label-blue } After running, the Van_Greenest_ProjectRaster should show up on your map.

A key advantage of Vector Data is that we can have multiple attributes associated with each entity (point/line/polygon). Here, we are interested in three variables: Population (total residents), Housing (monthly rent), and Income (annual total). **1**{: .label .label-red } Symbolize your census data by population. * Set the Field to Population * Change the symbology for Van_DA_2016 to Graduated Colors * Explore how the different classification schemes influence the way the classified layer looks on the map **2**{: .label .label-red } Make a Histogram of Population. * Set the number to population * Make sure the mean, median, and standard deviations are all shown on the Histogram. **3**{: .label .label-red } Create a chart income vs. housing. * Right click Van_DA_2016 and click Create Chart > Scatter Plot. * In the chart properties tab set: * **X-axis**: Income * **Y-axis**: Housing * Make sure \"Show linear trend\" is checked to display a regression line on your chart. **4**{: .label .label-red } Note the zero values on the X & Y Axes. Stats Canada \"suppresses\" data when they don't get enough responses to a census question. No house in Vancouver is worth $0. We need to exclude the zeros so they don't skew our results * In the Map tab, click **Select by Attribute**, select for \"Housing\" greater than 0 **And** \"Income\" greater than 0. * Select by Attribute allows us to select rows/objects with a certain attribute. * It relies on something called a Structured Query Language (SQL). * We are selecting all rows \"Where\" our conditions are met. * You can use the **And**/**Or** commands to combine querries. * **And**: Selects whre **All** statements are true * **Or**: Selects whre **Any** statements are true ## A Note on Linear Regression. A regression line is also know as a \"line of best fit\". [Linear regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression#Introduction) assumes the relationship between an X variable (eg. Income) and a Y variable (eg. Housing) follows a linear relationship (eg. Y=MX + B) where M is the slope and B is the intercept. * Any deviations from this linear relationship are \"errors\". That is, all the other variability that cannot be explained by the model. Rental cost is impacted by many factors (eg. scarcity) that aren't as easy to capture with census data alone. * In the example below for Van_DA_2016 (before excluding zeros), M = 0.0123 and b = 660.1, which means at $0 income, rent is $660.1. And for every $100 increase in income, rent goes up $1.23. The R2 score, is known as the [coefficient of determination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_determination). It is a measure of how well a model fits the data. It ranges from 0 to 1, with 0 representing \"no fit\" and 1 representing a \"perfect fit\". * This table shows how we assess the strength of a relationships indicated by the R2 statistics. In the example above, there is no strong relationship. |R2| Relationship|-------------|-------------|0.7 | Strong | ## Comparing CTs to DAs Repeat the steps above for the VanCMA_CT_2016 layer. **Don't forget** to exclude the zeros on your scatter plot. Note there are fewer zeros overall. Think about why that might be. **Hint** look at the population of CTs compared to DAs # Visualizing and Classifying Raster Data These NDVI data are in **Raster** format. An important caveat of raster data layers is they can only have **one** value per cell. However, they are useful because they allow us to represent continuous phenomena (i.e. vegetation health) as a simple image. ## Create a Histogram To get a feel for the distribution of NDVI values in the dataset, we're going to plot them in a histogram to aid our visual inspection of the NDVI data. **1**{: .label .label-blue } Create a chart showing the count of cells by NDVI values. * A histogram represents a distribution by grouping the data into bins (ranges), and plotting the count of values (eg. raster cells) for by bin. * Change the bin number to see how changing the size of the bins, impacts how you perceive the data. Try 10, then try 50. ## Use The Natural Breaks Classification **2**{: .label .label-blue } Search for the Reclassify tool in the geoprocessing pane. Use the projected NDVI layer as the input. * Click classify to set the classification scheme. Set the method to **Natural Breaks** and the number of classes to 3. * We talked about the Natural Breaks Classification in [Module 3](https://geos270.github.io/Module3/docs/Content_Part2.html). * It is designed to automatically find an \"optimal\" fit to a dataset. * We can use it to group the NDVI values into three classes: * 1: Water/Urban (lowest values) * 2: Medium Density Residential (middle values) * 3: Green Vegetation (highest values) # Change the Base Map To help inspect the NDVI classification, we can change the base map and look at a satellite image layer. * On the Map tab click \"Basemap\" and choose Imagery * Toggle the NDVI Layer and classified image on and off to see how the NDVI values correspond to green vegetation on the visible imagery base map layer.

    "content": "{: .text-delta } 1. TOC {:toc} --- # Spatial Analysis {: .no_toc } A key aspect of GIS is overlaying multiple data layers to generate new information. There are typically multiple solutions to a given problem in GIS. Here, we are going to look at two methods for combining a raster layer and a vector layer: 1) **Zonal Statistics**: This method is faster, but can be applied in a more limited number of circumstances. 2) **Raster to Polygon Conversion**: This method involves converting between data types and requires more a few steps, but it is more flexible. # Clean Up Your Workspace Selection From here on out, we are only goin to be working with the VanCMA_CT_2016 so you can remove the Van_DA_2016 layer. # Method 1 ## Zonal Statistics as Table We are going to overlay the vector data on the raster data to measure the mean NDVI value for each census tract using the **Zonal Statistics as Table** tool. Then we will **Join** the resulting output table to add the NDVI values by CT to the layer. A **join** is a way to add tables to a layer based on a specific column. You can reference the video below for guidance. **1**{: .label .label-red } Find the Zonal Statistics as Table tool in the Geoprocessing pane, choose **VanCMA_CT_2016** as the feature zone data, and **Van_Greenest_ProjectRaster** as the Input value raster. * Set CTUID as the Zone Field * Select All statistics types **2**{: .label .label-red } Right click on VanCMA_CT_2016 and choose Joins and Relates > Add Join. * Set CTUID as the Input Join Field * Choose the Zonal Statistics table as your input. *(the name should look something like ZonalST_VanCMA_1)* * Make sure CTUID is selected as the Join Table Field as well **3**{: .label .label-red } Inspect the Join * Open the attribute table and note the new columns at the end # Method 2 ## Raster to Polygon Conversion and Intersection We are going to convert the classified raster layer to a vector layer. Then we can overlay the resulting vector layer with the VanCMA_CT_2016 layer using an intersect which will let us calculate the total green vegetation area per CT in the next step. You can reference the video below for guidance. **1**{: .label .label-green } Find the **Raster to Polygon** tool in the geoprocessing pane. * Set the Classified NDVI image as the Input raster * Choose Value as the Field **2**{: .label .label-green } Find the [Intersect tool](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/tool-reference/analysis/intersect.htm) in the geoprocessing pane. It will combine the feature classes where they overlap and exclude all other areas. We'll talk a lot more about this tool. * Set Van_DA_2016 and the output from the raster to polygon conversion as the inputs. Then click run. * Change the symbology and open the attribute table to confirm the results look like what we'd expect. ## Calculate the Green Vegetation Area and Dissolve by CT Now we are going to calculate the total green vegetation area by CT, and toss out a bunch of the unnecessary data. You can reference the video below for guidance. **1**{: .label .label-blue } Add a new field to the VanCMA_CT_2016_Intersect layer called \"Green_Veg_Area\" so we * Name the field Green_Veg_Area * Make sure the data type is **Double**. **2**{: .label .label-blue } Choose Select by Attribute and set your query to: Where gridcode is equal to 3. **3**{: .label .label-blue } Right click on Green Veg Area and choose **Calculate Field**. This allows us to define a function and apply it to the table. * Set the expression to: Green_Veg_Area = Shape_Area * *Note* you only need to complete the right side of the equation * This will simply copy the shape area for the green vegetation areas, we will work with a more complex expression on the next page. **4**{: .label .label-blue } We want to assign all other rows a 0. We can quickly invert our selection with the **Switch** button. * Calculate the field again, but with Green_Veg_Area = 0 * We have selected gridcode 1 & 2 (Not vegetation) so they all get zeros. ## Data Normalization One last thing step! We need to account for a confounding factor. The CTs are different sizes. To better compare the CTs (which are vastly different sizes), lets Normalize our results by the total area of each CT! **Normalizing**, sometimes also referred to as standardizing, is the process of dividing one variable by another variable to account for their relationship. It can help us identify patterns that might be masked by a confounding variable. **1**{: .label .label-yellow } Add a new field called \"PCT_Green_Space\". * Make sure you set the data type to **Double** **2**{: .label .label-yellow } Calculate the field using the following equation: * PCT_Green_Space = SUM_Green_Veg_Area/Shape_Area * *Note* you only need to complete the right side of the equation **3**{: .label .label-yellow } Right click on PCT_Green_Space and select \"Statistics\" * This will bring up some descriptive statistics for this field. # Inspect and Compare the Outputs Lets see how the two methods compare? **1**{: .label .label-green } Open the Attribute Table of VanCMA_CT_NDVI_Veg. Double click on **Mean_NDVI** to sort by that column in ascending/descending order. Take note of the CTUIDs for of the CTs with the highest values. Now look at **SUM_Green_Veg_Area** and **PCT_Green_Space**. Do they all match up, or are there some differences? **2**{: .label .label-green } Create a new Scatter plot. Set the X-axis to **Mean_NDVI** and the Y-axis to **SUM_Green_Veg_Area**. Look at the R2 score and think about the relationship between these variables. Now change the Y-axis to **PCT_Green_Space** and not how the relationship changes. **3**{: .label .label-green } Change X-axis to **Mean_NDVI** the Y-axis to **Housing**. Make sure to **Exclude the zeros** using the same procedure as earlier then look at the resulting relationship. Is the **Mean_NDVI** a good predictor of housing cost? Try changing the X-axis to **PCT_Green_Space** to see if it gives a better result? ",

A data model is just a simplified abstractions of reality. # Spatial Data Models Spatial Data has some unique properties which mean we need to implement specific strategies to work with it. There are two key formats we work with in GIS for spatial data: **Raster** and **Vector**. Both models can be used to represent most spatial phenomena; but they are not equally suited for all applications. ## Learning Outcomes ### Lecture - Overview of different types of phenomena - Overview of different types of data - Differentiate between raster and vector data models. - Learn how each model represents space and stores attributes. - Learn which types of models are best suited for different applications. - Overview of data resolution and how it relates to scale. # How do we represent Geographic Information digitally? Now that we've covered how we project spatial data, we can learn how we actually represent that spatial data in a computer. But first, lets take a step back and talk more broadly about data. What are data? A collection of information (qualitative or quantiative) that describe a phenomena. What makes spatial data different from other types of data? The spatial coordinates must be treated differently (projected). Further, spatial relationshps like proximity must be accounted for. Do similar issues arise with temporal data? Yes! Time units must be treated differently and temporal relationshps like proximity are generally important. ### Lab * Experience a Typical GIS Workflow * Explore Canadian Census Data * Download Data from Google Earth Engine * Work with Raster and Vector Data Layers * Conduct Spatial Analysis * Normalize and Classify Data * Create Charts # Deliverables Every module will be scored out of 100 pts. For this module will be be submitting one map and a some written responses. You will also be taking a quiz consisting of multiple choice, numeric input, fill in the blank, etc. type questions. See the [assessment page](docs/Assessment.md). ",
